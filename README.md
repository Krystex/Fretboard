> An interactive fretboard visualization for learning music theory
> 
> Work in progress.

## Run Locally

To run it locally, just clone the repository and open `index.html`.

## Develop
All the computations for music theory are bundled in `musictheory.js`, the actual visualizations are in `fretboard.js`.

To automatically reload the application while coding, you can use `serve`:

```bash
npm install -g serve
serve .
```
